Experimental Variability:
* Subject
* Visit number
* Project (data come from subjects initially enrolled in projects 9, 10, and 15)
* LPS_DOSE: whether the sample was incubated (LPS_0) or not (Non_LPS)
* silanized_LPS: whether the vial used was silanized or not
* Plate: which plate was used to measure cytokines from this specific sample

Biological Factors:
* Gender (biological sex)
* BMI (averaged across all visits for a subject)
* PulseRate
* Diastolic BP
* Systolic BP
* Approx Age

Lifestyle Factors: Medications, Caffeine or Nicotine use on the day of blood collection

Mood Data: Individual items from GAD7; ISI; MASQ; PHQ9, PCL5_month, PHQ15
Sorted into 8 mood factors: 
* PTSD (19 variables from pcl5); 
* Positive Affect (high score = less positive affect; more symptomatic; includes 14 variables from MASQ)
* Sleep-Related Symptoms (includes 12 measures of sleep quality from a combination of PHQ15, PHQ9, PCL5, and ISI)
* Anxiety (includes 9 variables total: 7 from GAD7 and two from PHQ9)
* Anhedonia (7 variables from MASQ)
* Somatic Anxiety (includes: health9_heart; health8_faint, health7_dizzy, health6_chest)
* Suicideal Ideation (includes: dep2_down; dep9_dead, and MAS122_suicide)
* GI-Related Symptoms (includes: health12_constipation, health1_stomach, and health13_nausea)
